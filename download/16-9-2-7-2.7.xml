      <value>Some people think that books are the main source of human knowledge, summaries of what people have acquired in their struggle with nature and society. Moreover, with the rapid development of modern society, book knowledge is updated from time to time. For these people, books are everything. However, book knowledge is not everything! Books can never cover all the things and happenings in the world. Book knowledge is only a recording of what has been discovered. There are many mysteries unsolved and we can find no answers from books up to now. So if one does not try to learn something beyond books, it will be difficult for one to cope with some practical problems. We should develop our ability through practice and observing the world. It is not practical to rely on books only.</value>
