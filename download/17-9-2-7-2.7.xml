      <value>Bad habit can ruin your health. For example, excessive coffee drinking can bring side effects. Excessive coffee drinking will stain teeth and cause stomach irritation. Another bad habit is to skip breakfast, which is very common among city dwellers. The stomach produces acids during the night; without food in the morning, these acids will irritate the stomach. Without breakfast, you are more likely to suffer from fatigue, an upset stomach, or a headache. Just the opposite of skipping breakfast is eating too much before sleep. This habit will contribute to the problem of being overweight. Of course, there are many other bad habits that can harm your health, such as smoking and drinking to excess. Doctors have been advising people to get rid of these annoying habits and lead healthier lives.</value>
