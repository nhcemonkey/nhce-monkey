      <value>What should we do in order to become successful learners? The following are some suggestions. Concentrating. Good learners allow no interruptions in their study time. Once they set to study, they don&apos;t answer phone calls, watch TV, or read newspapers. Studying everywhere. Good learners are good at studying everywhere. For example, they practice speaking English to themselves when waiting for a meeting to start or for the bus to come. Some of them stick a vocabulary list on their bathroom wall and learn a new word every day while brushing their teeth. Taking notes. Good learners divide a page into two parts: Write notes on the right and put down the main ideas on the left. At the end of each class, they write a few sentences about the lesson&apos;s main points.</value>
