      <value>Parents differ from children in their career choice. The question of who should be responsible for planning their career often causes problems for many children. Parents think that they know their children well enough to decide what kind of job suits them. They are afraid that their children are too young to decide their future on their own. However, many children would argue that they should be left free to make their own choices. The other aspect of career choice is that parents and their children are often different in their opinions of the ideal profession. Parents would prefer children to choose some professions that are stable and could bring prestige and economic benefits. But some children would rather choose professions that are challenging and require independent and creative thinking.</value>
