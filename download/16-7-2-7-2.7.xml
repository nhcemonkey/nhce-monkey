      <value>My friend Jack has become a workaholic. He has too strong a desire to prove himself. According to him, good enough is never good enough. While others want only to finish a few things, he aims to do everything by himself. Also, he is unwilling to spend time with his family or friends, playing with the dog, or going fishing. He would feel guilty if he did so, because he believes that all his time should be spent working. He even wishes that he could have a day of 26 hours or even more. He has become a workaholic whether he likes it or not.</value>
