      <value>There are some key steps in career planning. The first one is to study yourself. Understanding what you are like, what you value, and what you become is the foundation for career planning. In studying yourself, you examine your strengths, your weaknesses and your goals. The second step is to write your career goals down. Write something down may lead to new ideas and may help you see your possibilities. Another step is to review your plans and progress periodically. This may help you see how you have done so far and help you realize what steps to take next. Planning further steps can help you face new changes. Talking with your friends helps you improve your career plans and make them work.</value>
