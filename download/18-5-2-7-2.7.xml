      <value>Some people prefer to live alone whereas some others have to live alone for one reason or another. Those people believing in inspirational solitude argue that no companion is more companionable than solitude. Literary giants such as William Wordsworth, John Milton and Henry Thoreau enjoyed living alone on purpose. Hunters or explorers enjoy themselves as they venture out to tame the great wild areas. On the other hand, there are some other people who have to live alone due to various reasons: being divorced, widowed or never married. Many of them feel bitter to live in solitude. They have no one to talk to and as a result they talk at length to themselves and to their pets and to the television.</value>
