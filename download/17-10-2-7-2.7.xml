      <value>Shopping has changed in recent years. Going shopping took time and strength in the past. If you were to buy food, household items and clothing, you had to visit different shops. Sometimes they were not within walking distance. You had to take a bus to go from one place to another. It was not unusual that shopping would take you a whole day and at the time you returned home, you&apos;d be completely exhausted. In contrast, shopping nowadays has become something enjoyable. A lot of supermarkets, in which prices are usually lower and a wider variety of items are offeredâ€•mainly food, household items, clothing, bedding and furniture or even anything that is out of your imagination. So you can buy everything you need in a single supermarket. Most of the supermarkets operate on the &quot;serve yourself&quot; method: You go in, pick up a basket, walk round it and choose what you want. At the exit there is a checkout lane where you pay for everything at one time.</value>
