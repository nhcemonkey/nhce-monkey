      <value>Computers, just like any new technology, have a negative side. As more and more computers are used in production lines, many jobs are being taken over by computer-controlled machines. As a result, many workers are finding themselves jobless. This constitutes a threat to social security. Another problem is computer crimes. For example, some people are finding ways to break into the bank computer systems and transfer large sums of money to their own accounts. There have been many reports like this. One more negative effect of computers is that they bring about health problems. Sitting in front of computers all day undoubtedly affects people's health. Back pain, wrist pain, failing eyesight, to name only a few.</value>
