      <value>My hometown and my college town have several things in common. First, my hometown is a small town. It has a population of only about 10,000 people. Located in a rural area, it is surrounded by many acres of farmland which are devoted mainly to growing corn and soybeans. As for my college town, it is small too. Having a population of about 11,000 local residents, it lies in the center of farmland which is used to raise hogs and cattle. Therefore living in my college town makes me feel at home. I enjoy it.</value>
