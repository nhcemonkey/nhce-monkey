      <value>It is reported that Chinese students are doing far better than American students in their studies. What are the reasons? That Chinese have strong belief in hard work is the first of the two main factors contributing to Chinese students&apos; outstanding performance. Chinese students believe that through hard work and effort, people can perfect themselves and gain a better future for themselves. And they have also set higher standards for themselves. The second factor is that Chinese students have a strong duty to their families. They work hard not just for themselves but for the honor of their families. They have a high sense of responsibility. They believe that they do not deserve the support of their parents unless they do well in their studies. The two important factors are the major causes why Chinese students do so well in their studies.</value>
