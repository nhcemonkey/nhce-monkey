      <value>Rhetorical questions are mainly intended to stir up the readers&apos; emotions, to put them off guard, making them ready to accept the writer&apos;s opinion. Rhetorically, this is called emotional appeal. By using rhetorical questions four times, the writer of this text is appealing to the readers to accept the idea &quot;Don&apos;t just say no to human cloning&quot;. With all the above in view, we can see that the text is persuasive.</value>
