      <value>The speed and efficiency of today&apos;s computers are working wonders for our age. Computer-controlled machinery is taking over many boring and dangerous jobs. Computers are working more reliably and efficiently and saving a lot of time for more creative work! By sharing information with people all over the world, people are tracking down criminals without losing a second. In addition, computers instantly send messages thousands of miles away so that we can hear or see what is happening at the other end of the world. Computers never get tired and they can work 24 hours a day. Computers are making our lives much easier than before. All we have to do is just to CLICK and the computers do everything for us.</value>
