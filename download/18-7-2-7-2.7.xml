      <value>Sticking to high moral standards is easier said than done. Once, a young British car sales manager who had just finished courses on business ethics was sent to sell cars to an African country. The negotiations had been going on for months without any real results. He was at his wits&apos; end. Finally, he hit upon a solution. One day he bought a popular novel and slipped a check of ï¿¡20,000 in the book. Then he presented it to the minister in charge of transportation. This minister examined its contents, pretending he didn&apos;t see the check at all. Then he said with a smile:&quot;Young man, I hear London is at its best in May. &quot; The sales manager, who was quick-witted, replied: &quot;My company in London will be most honored to welcome your visit!&quot; A short time later, the deal was approved in London!</value>
