      <value>It is difficult to get a welfare client&apos;s wheelchair repaired. Once my wheelchair needed repairing, and I notified my caseworker. She gave me a lecture that I hadn&apos;t taken good care of my wheelchair. Then she told me that I must have the patience to wait until she had the time to report my wheelchair conditions to my medical worker. Then the medical worker called the wheelchair repair companies to get the cheapest bid and informed the main welfare office at the state capital. It took them another several days to consider the matter. When they finally got my wheelchair repaired, I had been confined to bed for more than half a month.</value>
