      <value>Small in size and light in weight, electronic dictionaries are convenient to use. They are easy to carry and students can take them anywhere they go. Whenever they come across a new word in reading, they can find out its meaning with the help of an electronic dictionary. An electronic dictionary usually contains the information of several paper dictionaries. When students have one such dictionary, they actually have more than one dictionary in hand. Meanwhile, electronic dictionaries are time-saving. They save students from turning pages over to find the word. Instead, they only need to key in the word and the meaning will appear on the screen. Considering all the above factors, no wonder more and more students are using electronic dictionaries nowadays.</value>
