      <value>The region has been seriously polluted by harmful smog, which proves to be the cause of many illnesses and for the climbing death rate. As a result, people have started to move out of the area. In response to the problem, the local government has decided to fight against air pollution. It has closed down several factories, which were considered to be the major cause of the pollution. Many power plants have been modernized to give off less pollution and also moved further away from people&apos;s homes so as to decrease the damage. At the same time, the local government has decided to plant trees in and around the region because trees can absorb some of the pollution. People welcome all the measures taken by the government. Consequently, more and more people have begun to move back to the region to take part in this battle for a clean environment.</value>
