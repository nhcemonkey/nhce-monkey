      <value>Many people place so much emphasis on success that they think any failure is bad. Failure is never pleasant because it hurts people. But in fact it can make a positive contribution to our life once we learn how to make the best of it. We can learn from a disastrous party how to give a good one. And we can learn from an ill-chosen first house what to look for in a second. Even a total failure can give us fresh ideas or a change of direction. Repeated failures lead to success and prove to be beneficial to us as we experiment every day to find out the right way of doing things.</value>
