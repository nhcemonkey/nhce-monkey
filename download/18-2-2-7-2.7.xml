      <value>Charlie Chaplin is a great comic for his native land Britain, but even more so for the world. On the stage he often wore tiny moustaches, huge pants and tailcoats that were perhaps more characteristic of Europeans and may be not much of the British. Since more than half of the roles Chaplin played were in silent films, people throughout the world had no difficulty understanding his films. With sound movies, Chaplin created a nonsense language that sounded like no known nationality and was accepted and appreciated by people all over the world. For most of his lifetime he did not stay in his mother country; he traveled throughout the world to appear on stage for people of different nationalities.</value>
