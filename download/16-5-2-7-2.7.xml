      <value>There are many problems for mixed marriages. The number one reason is the cultural differences between the mixed couple, like those in customs and lifestyle. Many people have prejudice against mixed marriages. They often feel shocked to see people of different races get married and have doubts about such marriages. What's more, children from mixed marriages tend to be looked down upon or even badly treated by their peers. Mixed marriages face many trials, and as a result, mixed couples have higher divorce rates than couples of the same race.</value>
