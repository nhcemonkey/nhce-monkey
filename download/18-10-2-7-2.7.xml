      <value>There are a number of reasons to explain why the leisure industry is rapidly expanding in Japan. It is a government-led leisure boom. Japanese workers labor about 200 more hours per year than the average of American workers, according to figures from Japan&apos;s Labor Ministry. Under complaint that the Japanese labor force is working too much, the government is vigorously promoting the concept of &quot;leisure&quot;. More leisure time is available. Some companies require employees to take longer vacations, and others are moving to eliminate the traditional Saturday workday so that people will have more leisure opportunities. More leisure centers are constructed. Hundreds of amusement parks, sports centers and resorts are opening all over Japan. They are trying to provide all kinds of leisure facilities and activities for the Japanese people to enjoy.</value>
