      <value>Compare the new welfare system with the old one and you would find a world of difference between the two. Under the new welfare system, the law encourages welfare clients to work on their own for a gradual shift away from welfare, and this is not the case in the past. Welfare clients now can develop their talents to make money. In the past, they often cheated to bleed the system for a few extra dollars. Now caseworkers will gladly help their clients find appropriate jobs rather than act like detectives to try to seek out any unreported properties. Today many welfare clients have made a choice to live a life of complete honesty and they tell the truth to caseworkers and declare any extra income they make. In cases like this, caseworkers will feel greatly relieved because they don&apos;t need to search for any cheating as in the past.</value>
