For college students, the most popular subjects that they prefer to choose are accounting, computer programming, business, etc. When they graduate from colleges, the jobs they prefer to choose are sales representative, advertisement designing, international business, etc. Fewer and fewer people are choosing teaching or social services as their life career.</value>
