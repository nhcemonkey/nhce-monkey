      <value>There are serious security problems in Brooklyn, New York. Not long ago a young lady was murdered at a time still early in the evening. Marissa Parry was returning home from the job at about 9 in the evening. She was walking the 100-foot distance from the parking lot to the entrance of her apartment. Suddenly a man attacked her from behind. He grabbed her and stabbed her with a knife. Miss Parry struggled and screamed for help. But no one came to help her. The man stabbed her again! Then the man got into his car and drove away. Miss Parry could no longer stagger to her feet; she lay just a few feet away from her apartment, dying.</value>
