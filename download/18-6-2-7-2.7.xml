      <value>Typically there are two kinds of people who choose to live alone on purpose. The first group of people is artists. They believe in the inspiration in solitude. One of my friends is a writer. He enjoys the time when he is alone because he can stay up late to read and, above all, concentrate on his writing without fear of being interrupted by others. On his wall he posts a quotation from Thoreau: &quot;I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.&quot; The second group consists of people who are disappointed with their marriage or family life. A woman I know has been living alone since her husband left her five years ago. She is not waiting for his return but she is just disappointed with life.</value>
