      <value>To many people, a cowboy is a fantastic hero. A cowboy is a tall and strong man, wearing cowboy hat and boots, riding a horse and with guns around his waist. He remains alert to everything around him all the time. When danger is around, he never fails to sense or detect it, and he is always brave to face the danger. A cowboy is a skilled horseman and good gunman. He is a hero who helps the good people while punishing the bad. He seems like a superman who appears where he is needed. A cowboy does what&apos;s right and refuses money for his good actions, because he does not care about money. What he cares about is doing justice.</value>
